                <p>
                    CollectiveGood aims to gather, verify, and group medical cases to help professionals enhance and get second opinions on diagnoses.

                    This application seeks to use the collective intelligence of medical professionals from different backgrounds, from surgeons to nurses, 
                    to provide training and second opinions when creating diagnoses. It has been shown that this collective intelligence is often as 
                    accurate as diagnoses from higher-ranking physicians.

                    To achieve the idea of collective intelligence, this application allows users to field information about uploaded medical cases as well as review
                    and comment on cases submitted by other users before being put into a collective database of all completed cases. This allows for a
                    collaborative effort to ensure that all cases are accurate and complete.

                    <h2 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h2>
                    <p>The <a routerLink="/home">Dashboard</a> is the landing page upon logging in and is used to 
                        display a quick view of what tasks have been assigned to you.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New Cases: These are cases that have been newly assigned to you to look over and review.
                            Clicking on the title of the case will take you to a page where you can view the raw case
                            data and fill out the necessary fields to complete the case.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cases To Review: These are cases that have been assigned to you to review. Clicking on the
                            title of the case will take you to a page where you can view the raw case data as well as the
                            original submission.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Submitted Cases: These are cases that you have submitted for review, but have not been reviewed yet.
                            Once the case has been reviewed, it will show up in the Case Archive.
                        </li>

                    <h2 id="case-info-submit">Case Information Submission Page</h2>
                    <p>
                        Clicking on a case from the "New Cases" dashboard column will direct you this page, where you can view 
                        the raw case data and fill out the necessary fields to complete the case. Once you have filled out the
                        form, you have the option to either submit the case for review or save the case as a draft. If you save
                        as a draft, you can come back to the case at a later time to finish filling out the form. Once you have
                        submitted the case for review, your submission will show up in your reviewer's dashboard and you can no 
                        longer make edits to it. You will then be redirected back to the dashboard, where your submission will
                        move to the "Submitted Cases" dashboard column.

                    <h2 id="case-info-review">Case Information Review Page</h2>
                    <p>
                        Clicking on a case from the "Cases To Review" dashboard column will direct you this page, where you can view 
                        the raw case data as well as the form submission. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Completing a Case Review</h3>
                    <p>The case review page organizes the form fields into categories, with the first one displaying by default.
                        Clicking on a category will expand that section and display the form fields within that category.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Comments: To add or edit a comment, click the comment icon (<mat-icon>comment</mat-icon>) next to the form field.
                            This will open a text box where you can type your comment. Once you have finished typing your comment, click
                            the "Save" button under the form field to post your comment. Fields that already have comments on them will have
                            a pink comment button and fields without existing comments will have a blue comment button.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Once you have added comments to review the case, you have the option to either submit the review or save the 
                        review as a draft. If you save as a draft, you can come back to the review at a later time to finish adding
                        comments. After completing the review, you will no longer be able to add comments and the case is considered
                        complete. It will be removed from both the original submitter's and the reviewer's dashboard and will show up in
                        the Case Archive.
